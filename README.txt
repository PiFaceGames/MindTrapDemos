ReadME
This file is the read me document for this project. In this folder there are builds of my game Mind Trap for windows 64 and 32 bit. These versions are configured for touch controls as well as keyboard and controller input. To play the game, download the zip file that applies to your machine. Extract the contents and run the UnrealStickFigure2D.exe application in the folder named WindowsNoEditor. Don't move any files around or you will run into problems running the game. There is no music in these versions, however there are some sound effects and the volume needs to be adjusted to the doors so it may be a bit loud if you are using headphones.
